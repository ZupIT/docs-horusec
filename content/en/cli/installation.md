  In this section, you will find guidelines to install Horusec-CLI.
---

There are 4 ways to install Horusec-CLI:

1. Local Installation 
2. Manual Installation  
3. Installation via Imagem Docker 
4. Installation via Pipeline

Next, you will understand better each one of them. 

## **Requirements**
For usage is required some tools installed in your machine:
* [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (recommended version ```19.03.11```). For disable docker, you can see [**how to use Horusec without Docker tutorial**]({{< ref path="tutorials/how-to-use-horusec-without-docker.md" lang="en">}}), but you will lose your analysis with [**other tools**]({{< ref path="cli/analysis-tools/security-tools" lang="en">}}).
* [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) (recommended version ```2.25.1```). For running analysis with git, you can see [**how to enable git history analysis tutorial**]({{< ref path="tutorials/how-to-enable-git-history-analysis-and-enable-commit-authors.md" lang="en">}}), but it is not enable by default.

## **Local Installation**
The installation directly done in your computer is ideal if you want to use Horusec as soon as possible, either to perform analysis or verify vulnerabilities in your project. 

Check out next, the command you need to install Horusec locally according to your operating system. 


### **MAC or Linux**
To install Horusec-CLI on MacOS or Linux, you have to run the command below in your terminal: 

```bash

{{% alert color="info" %}}
After downloading the files for Mac or Linux it will be necessary to make them `executable` through the command `chmod +x`.
```bash
chmod +x path/horusec_[your version here]
```
Having run this command, you will now be able to open the file for manual installation.

## **Installation via image docker**

Another way to carry out your analysis is through a docker image that you can run locally or use in your pipeline. 

See some use cases below:

### **Starting image with run command:**

When you initialize the image with the `run` command, just run Horusec with the command you want.

```bash
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(pwd):/src horuszup/horusec-cli:latest horusec start -p /src -P $(pwd)
```

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Check if the environment you are working allows you to create a bidirectional volume, because this is necessary to use Horusec in a docker image.

## **Installation via pipeline:**

This type of installation assures the safety in the deliver of your project in production, since Horusec is added to your pipeline.

See next the ways to install considering different types of pipeline:

### Github Actions

```yaml
name: SecurityPipeline

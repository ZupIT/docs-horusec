There are 4 ways to install Horusec-CLI:

1. Local Installation 
2. Manual Installation  
3. Installation via Imagem Docker 
4. Installation via Pipeline

Next, you will understand better each one of them. 

## **Requirements**
For usage is required some tools installed in your machine:
* [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  - {{% alert color="warning" %}}
For disable docker, you can see [**how to use Horusec without Docker tutorial**](/docs/tutorials/how-to-use-horusec-without-docker/), but you will lose your analysis with [**other tools**](/docs/cli/analysis-tools/security-tools/).
    {{% /alert %}}
* [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)
  - {{% alert color="warning" %}}
For running analysis with git, you can see [**how to enable git history analysis tutorial**](/docs/tutorials/how-to-enable-git-history-analysis-and-enable-commit-authors/), but it is not enable by default.

## **Installation via image docker**

Another way to carry out your analysis is through a docker image that you can run locally or use in your pipeline. 

See some use cases below:

### **Starting image with run command:**

When you initialize the image with the `run` command, just run Horusec with the command you want.

```bash
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(pwd):/src horuszup/horusec-cli:latest horusec start -p /src -P $(pwd)
```

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Check if the environment you are working allows you to create a bidirectional volume, because this is necessary to use Horusec in a docker image.

## **Installation via pipeline:**

This type of installation assures the safety in the deliver of your project in production, since Horusec is added to your pipeline.

See next the ways to install considering different types of pipeline:

### Github Actions

```yaml
name: SecurityPipeline

on: [push]

jobs:
  horusec-security:
    name: horusec-security
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Check out code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Running Horusec Security
      run: |
        curl -fsSL https://horusec.io/bin/install.sh | bash
        horusec start -p="./" -e="true"
```

### AWS Code Build

* **Environment:**

  * Managed image
  * Operational sytem: `Ubuntu`
  * Execution time: `Standard`
  * Image: `aws/codebuild/standard:3.0`
  * Image Version:  `Latest`
  * Environment type:  `Linux`
  * Enable this indicator if you want to create Docker images or want your builds to get elevated privileges:  `true`

* Buildspec:

```yaml
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      docker: 18
  build:
    commands:
      - docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(pwd):/src/horusec horuszup/horusec-cli:latest horusec start -p /src/horusec -P $(pwd)
```

### Circle CI

```yaml

    executor: horusec-executor
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Horusec Security Test
          command: |
            curl -fsSL https://horusec.io/bin/install.sh | bash
            horusec start -p="./" -e="true"
workflows:
  pipeline:
    jobs:
      - horusec
```

### Jenkins

```groovy
stages {
        stage('Security') {
            agent {
                docker { image 'docker:dind' }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'curl -fsSL https://horusec.io/bin/install.sh | bash'
                sh 'horusec start -p="./" -e="true"'
            }
        }
    }
```

### Azure DevOps Pipeline

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-18.04'

steps:
- script: curl -fsSL https://horusec.io/bin/install.sh | bash && horusec start -p ./
```

### GitLab CI/CD

```yaml
image: docker:latest

services:
  - docker:dind

build-code-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(pwd):/src/horusec horuszup/horusec-cli:latest horusec start -p /src/horusec -P $(pwd)
```

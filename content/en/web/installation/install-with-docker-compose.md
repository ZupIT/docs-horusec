description: In this section, you will find how to install Horusec web application in your environment using docker-compose.

## **What is it?** 

[**Docker-Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)  is a tool to configure your application's services and also execute Docker applications in lots of containers. You can create and start all your configuration services with only one command. 

This installation uses Horusec's web application linked to your environment using Docker-Compose. 

{{% alert color="warning" %}} 
We don't recommend you to install Horusec using Docker-Compose in your **production environment** if you need that [**install with Helm**]({{< ref path="/web/installation/install-with-helm.md" lang="en">}}) or [**Operator**]({{< ref path="/web/installation/install-with-operator/overview.md" lang="en">}}).
{{% /alert %}}


## **Requirements**
Check out the requirements in the [**Set up section**]({{< ref path="/web/set-up.md" lang="en">}}) section. 


## **Configuration**
Horusec has a **configuration file** with default options for your enviroment configuration.
 
{{% alert color="info"%}}
This file can only be used for a testing scenario, don't use it for the production one.
{{% /alert %}}

- Get the [**configuration file**](https://github.com/ZupIT/horusec-platform/blob/main/deployments/compose/compose.yaml) on Horusec's repository.

Follow the next steps to configure:
**Step 1.** Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZupIT/horusec-platform.git

```

**Step 2.** Enter the folder you have cloned:

```bash
cd horusec-platform
```
**Step 3.** Run the command `make install` to have all web applications:

```bash
make install
```


## **Access Horusec's services**

Access the [**http://localhost:8043**](http://localhost:8043) to view the web application screens, showed by [**Horusec-Manager**]({{< ref path="/web/services/manager/introduction.md" lang="en">}}) service.

 

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The configuration file has all Horusec's services that will be exposed and executed in your machine.
{{% /alert %}}

## **Teste**
For test cases, Horusec gives you a default e-mail and a password to access the platform, see below:

```text
email: dev@example.com
password: Devpass0*
```

If you want to change or disable the default user of the system, check out [the  tutorial]({{< ref path="/tutorials/how-to-enable-disable-default-user.md" lang="en">}})

{{% alert color="info" %}}
All backend services are exposed using **network_mode: "host"**, check if you have [**enabled Docker's configurations**](https://docs.docker.com/network/host/) to use this functions.
{{% /alert %}}

## **Images**
Horusec's images are available on [**Dockerhub**](https://hub.docker.com/u/horuszup). You can check and use them, see below: 

* [**horuszup/horusec-manager**](https://hub.docker.com/r/horuszup/horusec-manager)
* [**horuszup/horusec-auth**](https://hub.docker.com/r/horuszup/horusec-auth)
* [**horuszup/horusec-core**](https://hub.docker.com/r/horuszup/horusec-core)
* [**horuszup/horusec-api**](https://hub.docker.com/r/horuszup/horusec-api)

* [**horuszup/horusec-messages**](https://hub.docker.com/r/horuszup/horusec-messages) (It is a requirement when you are using the [**e-mail service**]({{< ref path="/tutorials/how-to-enable-disable-messaging-service" lang="en">}})

# **Reminders**

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
1. All these configurations available on Horusec's [**docker-compose.yaml**](https://github.com/ZupIT/horusec-platform/blob/main/deployments/compose/compose.yaml) are default. We recommend you change some information (like the user and database password) when using this service in a production environment.


2. Horusec always updates the images and performs corrections to know which image to use in specific versions. Check out the [**Release Notes**](https://github.com/ZupIT/horusec/releases) to see the correct versions for each service.


3. There is [**a new policy access to download public Dockerhub images**](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/). We recommend you upload images in the register if you want to avoid problems. 

4. When you enable the messaging service, it is necessary to connect to your e-mail service. For that, add to **"horusec-messages"** the following environment variables:   
- HORUSEC_SMTP_USERNAME="e-mail service username";
- HORUSEC_SMTP_PASSWORD="e-mail password service";
- HORUSEC_SMTP_ADDRESS: "e-mail address service";
- HORUSEC_SMTP_HOST: "e-mail host service";
- HORUSEC_SMTP_PORT: "e-mail service port".

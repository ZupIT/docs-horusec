### **Stop analysis**

 When you stop the Horusec running analysis, the extension will remove the toolâ€™s analysis image, however this action is not recommended to be performed until the analysis is finished. 

### **Go to the vulnerable code**

In case a vulnerability is founded, the user can investigate it in the Horusec tab or in the Diagnostics section. By clicking on the vulnerability, Horusec will show the exact line that needs to be edited.

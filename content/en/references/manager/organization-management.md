Here you can see all the organizations you have created on the platform. You can also manage your organization's token or to make a permission management of your users. 

###  Organization's token 

The token is a resource you can create to use in your analysis. The main goal is to help Horusec identify the organization and the repository when the [**CLI** ](../../cli)sends a new analysis to the platform. 

For example, if you create an organization with 100 repositories, you will only need 1 access token. When you send an analyis to this repository, you will have to pass the repository's name you want to create or it already exists to the CLI. 

You have the option to create the token, but it is safer to generate only one to the repository and revoke it after a while. This way, you make sure the organization will always be safe.

Remember when creating an access token, it can only be seen once.
{{% /alert %}}

Check below how the token dashboard is in Horusec:

### Organization's users

You can invite new users to enter your organization. To do that, you have do register them in Horusec's database and at the end of the process, an email is sent to invite the users to enter it. 

When you invite, you have to choose the user's function inside the organization. There are two main funtions, each one has the following permissions:

1. **Manager**

   * Manage the organization \(view, update, remove\);
   * Manage organization's tokens \(create, view, update, remove\);
   * Manage organization's users \(invite, view, update, remove;
   * Add new repositories;
   * View all the repositories in the organization;
   * View the organization's dashboard;
   * View repositories' dashboard the user has access to.

2. **User**

   * View repositories' dashboard the user has access to.
